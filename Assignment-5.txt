Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
2.   Asks the user to input a student's name.
3.   Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
4.   If the studentâ€™s name is not found, display an appropriate message.


dictionary = {'Mohan': '85', 'Sohan': '81', 'Murat': '75', 'Preet': '65', 'Johan': '82'}

student_name = input("Enter the student's name: ")

marks = dictionary.get(student_name, None)

if marks is not None:
    print(f"{student_name}'s marks are: {marks}")
else:
    print(f"Student name not found for {student_name}.")

Task-2  

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
3.   Reverses these extracted elements.
4.   Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list



numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
first_five = numbers[:5]
print("First five elements:", first_five)


Ans

C:\Users\nirma\PycharmProjects\PythonProject\.venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\nirma\PycharmProjects\PythonProject\List.py 
First five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Process finished with exit code 0


 Reverses these extracted elements.

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
first_five = numbers[:5]
reversed_first_five = first_five[::-1]

print("Reversed first five elements:", reversed_first_five)
